# random-backrooms

This project is a demo of a liminal space backrooms kind of thing.

Uses some bizzare maze-generation algorithm which was partially generated by ChatGPT.

There is also a monster that uses some basic pathfinding. Right now he'll spawn somewhere random and pathfind to your starting location.
